    "\n",
    "Despite the continuous growth of ebooks over the past decade, the publishing industry continues to fulfill a significant demand for physical, printed books. The cost of distributing print books can vary structurally based on factors such as fixed vs variable, owned vs 3PL, and other differing permutations of distribution cost models. But one significant distribution cost that is relatively constant for all publishers is the cost of freight.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Wiley, freight costs for North American outbound volume alone can cost millions annually in USD. Although the current methods used to model these costs have been sufficient for financial planning purposes, there is most certainly room for improvement. Previous forecasts have been derived from very basic time series modeling, but we have not yet attempted to apply machine learning to improve our accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict the freight cost of physical book fulfillment (on both an individual shipment level and an aggregate level) by using supervised machine learning methods on a year’s worth of supply chain data out of our North American distribution center. By implementing a more complex modeling approach, we hope to improve our forecasting accuracy as well as gain better visibility into the main drivers of our costs.\n",

In terms of the data, this means that there are some outlier coefficients that have a negative correlation, meaning that as these variables go up, our freight cost goes down quite a bit (or, in the case of dummy variables, freight cost is much lower for the dummy variable classification than for other categorical classifications).  Given the data we're working with, this makes sense--our volume data includes a large number of shipments that aren't associated with any freight cost at all, so we can expect a lot of those cost-free shipments to have negative coefficients.\n",
